* **Low Risk:** Investment-grade assets, including AAA-rated U.S. sovereign bonds, offer stability and security and are highly liquid, with more than $100 billion traded daily.
* **Attractive Returns:** With the Federal Reserve rate expected to remain elevated, fixed-income products are attractive to crypto-native investors who lack easy access to this asset class.
* **Fully Regulated and Institutional-Grade Partners:** Cogito Finance collaborates with trusted and regulated partners to ensure compliance and mitigate risks.
* **24/7 Instant Settlement:** Smart contracts enable instant investment and redemption on-chain, providing investors with increased flexibility and convenience.
* **Real-Time Transparency:** Chainlinkâ€™s proof-of-reserves provides cryptographic verification that fund tokens are backed by underlying assets held in secure custodian accounts.
* **Transferability and Composability:** Fund tokens can be transferred and staked across different protocols, maximizing capital efficiency and flexibility for investors and enabling new use cases.\
